// Factory Pattern (Already Applied in IssueFactory)
// Purpose: This pattern is used to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. In your code, youâ€™ve used the IssueFactory to handle the creation of the Issue model objects.
// Benefits:
// Encapsulation of object creation.
// Easier to manage the creation of complex objects.
// Facilitates adding different types of issues in the future without modifying much code.
